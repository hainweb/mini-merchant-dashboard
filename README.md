## Backend Setup

### Frameworks and Libraries

- **Express**: Framework for Node.js
- **CORS**: To connect frontend and backend
- **Express.json**: To parse JSON data
- **Bcrypt**: For password security
- **Jsonwebtoken**: JWT for token creation and authentication
- **In-Memory Storage**: JavaScript arrays for data persistence

### Page Setups

#### Files
- **server.js**: Root file

#### Folders
- **controllers**: Route handler functions
- **data**: In-memory data storage (users and products arrays)
- **middleware**: JWT authentication middleware
- **models**: Data access layer functions
- **routes**: Set all routes in one place

---

## Frontend Setup

### Extra Libraries

- **Axios**: To make HTTP requests
- **React Hot Toast**: To show toast notifications
- **Chart.js**: For data visualization
- **React-chartjs-2**: React wrapper for Chart.js

### Folders and Files

#### Folders
- **components**: Reusable UI components (common, dashboard, products, layout)
- **pages**: Set pages for UI (Login, Dashboard)
- **services**: API configuration with Axios
- **hooks**: Custom React hooks (useProducts, useStats)
- **utils**: Helper functions and constants

---

## Technologies Used

- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling
- **JavaScript**: For functionalities
- **React.js**: JavaScript library for building fast and scalable UI
- **Node.js**: Backend runtime environment for JavaScript
- **Express.js**: Backend framework for Node.js
- **In-Memory Storage**: JavaScript arrays (no database)

---

## API Overview

### RESTful APIs HTTP Methods

1. **POST**: For login (verify user identity)
2. **GET**: To display user's products (read)
3. **POST**: To add a product (create)
4. **PUT**: To edit product details (update)
5. **DELETE**: To delete a product (delete)
6. **GET**: To display analytics statistics (read)

---

## Token Usage and Session Management

- **Token Usage**: JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are used for authentication. Upon successful login, a JWT is generated and sent to the client, which is then stored in local storage.
- **Session Management**: Protected routes are created that require a valid JWT to access. If the user is not authenticated, they are redirected to the login page.

---

## UI Setup

- **Login**: For authentication (email, password)
- **Header**: For navigation - (Dashboard title, user email, logout button)
- **Overview**: Display analytics - (total products, total value, categories, category breakdown)
- **ProductsTable**: To list product details - (table with product data with edit and delete buttons)
- **ProductForm**: To add/edit products - (modal with name, price, category, stock fields)

---

## Data Storage

- **users.js**: In-memory array to store user details (fields: id, email, password)
- **products.js**: In-memory array to store product details (fields: id, name, price, category, stock, ownerId)
